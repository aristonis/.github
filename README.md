EXCELLENCE IS A HABIT. ARISTONIS IS THE ELITE — MADE DAILY 
<h1 align="center">👋 Hello, I’m Aristonis</h1> <h3 align="center">Software Architect • Open Source Steward • Excellence by Design</h3>
“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”

### 📖 About Me ✏️ I am mekad alibrahem from syria  
I’m a software developer and open source contributor who believes elite engineering isn’t inherited — it’s built. Line by line. Commit by commit. Lesson by lesson. 
I specialize in designing clean, scalable systems and maintaining open source tools.
My work is guided by one principle: 
  - excellence is a daily choice — not a destination.

### 🎯 Core Principles - **Elite by Choice** — Greatness is earned through consistency, not gifted by birth. 
- **Code as Craft** — Software should be readable, reliable, and responsible. 
- **Open Source as Legacy** — I build in public so others can learn, fork, improve, and rise. 
- **Philosophy in Practice** — Aristotle’s virtues shape my architecture: balance, clarity, purpose.
